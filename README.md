# WebScraper

#Project to scrape concert information from local Boston area venues.  Goal is to extract the information from a list of websites and export to a csv file.  Hopefully, I'll then add the information to a shared Google Calendar.

Subtext: I want to get my husband out of the house and providing him with opportunities to see live music is the best way to do that.
